                <p>Between the vibrant energy of the Marhaba and the annual RealAD show, freshmen are given just two weeks to immerse themselves in the NYU Abu Dhabi experience for the very first time. Representing over 70 countries, NYUAD's latest cohort of freshmen embarks on an exciting four-year journey, but the shift from Marhaba week to regular university life can present its own unique set of challenges, catching many by surprise.</p>
                <p>The fast-paced nature of Marhaba is intentional. It's designed to help freshmen acclimate quickly to their new environment and establish connections with deans and fellow students. The excitement of Marhaba and the slowdown that follows can be disorienting, but remember, it's all part of the university experience.</p>
                <p>It's not uncommon for students to grapple with a sense of unease during this transition. The initial excitement and social buzz of Marhaba can dissipate, leaving some students feeling disconnected and uncertain about their place in the community.</p>
                <p>As you step away from the whirlwind of Marhaba, you may experience what some call the "Marhaba comedown." Suddenly, the focus shifts from social events and orientation activities to classes and academic responsibilities. This shift in pace can leave you feeling a bit adrift.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on my own experience, I acknowledge that transitioning from Marhaba to regular university life can be somewhat challenging. The connections formed during Marhaba may not necessarily evolve into deep friendships right away, but this is all part of the journey. True friendships tend to develop as students attend classes, join Student Interest Groups, and discover shared interests and passions.</p>
                <p>Feeling a little out of place during your freshman year is entirely normal, especially in the beginning. The transition to college life is a significant change from high school and can be a culture shock.</p>
                <p>While Marhaba attendance is mandatory, you can adopt strategies to make the transition smoother. Apart from the university's wellness services, consider the power of "managing your mood." This involves identifying personal strategies that help improve your emotional well-being, whether it's seeking support from back home or exploring new activities and clubs on campus.</p>
                <p>Learning positive self-talk is another technique to combat feelings of isolation. Instead of viewing yourself as isolated, recognize temporary loneliness and find ways to connect. Consider venturing beyond Saadiyat Island into the city; it can provide a refreshing change of scenery.</p>
                <p>NYUAD offers peer support through groups like REACH, which organizes informal meetings for freshmen to connect and share their experiences. Don't hesitate to engage with RAs and fellow students, even if it feels a bit awkward at first. Building connections and embracing new experiences can transform your university journey.</p>
                <p>Remember, the post-Marhaba transition is a part of the larger university experience. It's a time for growth, learning, and building connections that will last a lifetime. Embrace it with enthusiasm!</p>
