**Project Name:** NYUAD Freshman Starter Pack

**Project Description:** Our short video, which my partner and I collaborated on, creatively highlights the challenges and daily experiences of students, especially freshman, encounter on campus. The NYUAD Freshman Starter Pack expands this idea of our short video and it is designed to provide insights and support to NYUAD freshmen. The purpose of the website is to capture the essence of freshman experience on campus, offering advice and guidance from upperclassmen to ease the transition into university life. Loneliness and isolation are common feelings among freshmen, and this website seeks to ease these emotions by sharing the stories of others, fostering a sense of belonging.

**Process:** The final website's structure changed from its initial framework during the process, while I tried to emphasize simplicity by eliminating unnecessary columns. I wanted the pages to to more focused on the content, so I didn’t add any other columns of texts on the content page. A letter from an upperclassman is the first thing the user could see when visiting the website. I believe welcoming the users with this heartfelt letter would be a nice experience. Down the letter, three articles are included. I wanted to focus more on creating informative and engaging content because those contents are where the freshman could learn from. I wrote the articles on the website to convey my freshman year experience, addressing common challenges such as finding a sense of belonging and navigating the post-Marhaba comedown. Lastly, the homepage ends with the short video showcasing daily challenges of students on campus.

In terms of design, I chose a color scheme centered around NYUAD's signature purple, complemented by yellow for contrast. I also kept appropriate line lengths and concise paragraphs to make it easier for the user to read. However, I think the use of such heavy colors too much on the home page, I couldn’t really achieve the simplicity I was aiming to. I also thoughtfully chose the cover images on the website to deliver NYUAD atmosphere.

Due to my ability of coding, I have started coding my css only considering the size of my own screen. Later, I found out the website look misaligned when screen size is changed. So, I tried to fix it as much as I could.

Interactivity was integrated thoughtfully:

On the Main Page:

- Header content highlights on mouse hover.
- Image border radius changes on mouse hover.

On the Content Pages:

- Image source displays on mouse hover.
- "Back to Home" text is highlighted on mouse hover.

**Reflection/Evaluation:** While I am quite satisfied with the overall project, the video did not fully achieve its goal of conveying the message that freshmen are not alone in their journey. However, the written content effectively communicates the challenges of adjusting to academics and campus life while offering valuable advice. The navigation from the content page back to the home page could have been more intuitive, and I recognize the need for a navigation bar to enhance user experience.

In terms of simplicity, the home page may appear cluttered due to the use of heavy color (purple and yellow) and a lack of visual cohesion with the embedded video. This inconsistency is something I would like to address in my future works. Also, I didn't account for varying screen sizes during the coding process, which may result in alignment issues on different devices and resizing the window.

For future work, I will meticulously plan the framework, considering content and design cohesion. I will also prioritize responsive design to ensure a good user experience across different screen sizes. Also, I would like to include other interactivities other than the mouse hover to make the website more interesting and fun for the user to visit.
