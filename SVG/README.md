**Creating an image with Adobe Illustrator**Â 

In this exercise, I tried create an image of myself using Adobe Illustrator. I would say it was definitely challenging to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator and try to portray myself at the same time. Thus, the result is not so similar to how I look like in real life, but I am satisfied with how it turned out. I especially like her wink which looks really cute.
