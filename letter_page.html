                <p> Dear Freshman, </p>

                <p>Welcome to college, an exciting chapter in your lives filled with opportunities for growth and exploration. Over the next four years, you'll experience many new things, meet people from different backgrounds, and learn about various ideas. This time might help you discover where you belong in the world or what you want to do in the future. You can choose to settle into one path and grow steadily or embrace change and keep evolving. Either way, you'll have lots of questions, and it's perfectly okay not to have all the answers.</p>

                <p>Don't be afraid to try out different subjects and find what interests you the most. College is a time for trying new things and finding your passion. Take classes that catch your eye, even if they're not directly related to your major. For instance, you might explore our diverse range of courses, from environmental science to Middle Eastern studies. You might discover something you're really passionate about, and that can lead you to unexpected and exciting places.</p>

                <p> You'll also have the chance to meet people from all around the world at a diverse place like NYUAD. This is a great opportunity to learn about different cultures and perspectives. Talk to your fellow students, exchange stories, and open your mind to new ways of thinking. In college, you'll learn not only from textbooks but also from the people you meet.</p>

                <p> As you go through college, you'll face challenges and make mistakes - that's completely normal. Remember, it's okay to stumble along the way. What's important is to learn from your mistakes and grow. Don't compare yourself to others, as everyone's journey is unique. Focus on your personal progress and go at your own pace. </p>

                <p>Once again, welcome to college, where you can spread your wings and explore the world. Enjoy the ride, and make the most of this incredible journey filled with learning, self-discovery, and new experiences. It's a time to grow, so embrace it with enthusiasm!</p>

                <p> Warm regards, </p>
                <p> A fellow Upperclassmen </p>
