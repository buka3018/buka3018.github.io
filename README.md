Project Name: NYUAD Freshman Starter Pack

Project Description: The NYUAD Freshman Starter Pack is designed to provide insights and support to NYUAD freshmen. The purpose of the website is to capture the essence of freshman experience on campus, offering advice and guidance from upperclassmen to ease the transition into university life. Loneliness and isolation are common feelings among freshmen, and this website seeks to ease these emotions by sharing the stories of others, fostering a sense of inclusion within the NYUAD community.

Process: The final website's structure changed from its initial framework during the process, emphasizing simplicity by eliminating unnecessary columns. A letter from a upperclassman is the first thing the user could see when visiting the website. I believe welcoming the users with this heartfelt letter would be a nice experience. Down the letter, three articles are included. I wanted to focus more on creating informative and engaging content because those contents are where the freshman could learn from. I wrote the articles on the website to convey my freshman year experience, addressing common challenges such as finding a sense of belonging and navigating the post-Marhaba comedown.  Lastly, the homepage ends with the short video showcasing daily challenges of students on campus. 

In terms of design, I chose a color scheme centered around NYUAD's signature purple, complemented by yellow for contrast. This color combination not only represents the university but also enhances readability. I also kept appropriate line lengths and concise paragraphs to make it easier for the user to read.

Interactivity was integrated thoughtfully:

Main Page:

- Header content highlights on mouse hover.
- Image border radius changes on mouse hover.

Content Page:

- Image source displays on mouse hover.
- "Back to Home" text is highlighted on mouse hover.

Reflection/Evaluation: While I am quiet satisfied with the overall project, the video did not fully achieve its goal of conveying the message that freshmen are not alone in their journey. However, the written content effectively communicates the challenges of adjusting to academics and campus life while offering valuable advice. The navigation from the content page back to the home page could have been more intuitive, and I recognize the need for a navigation bar to enhance user experience.

To achieve simplicity, the home page may appear cluttered due to the use of heavy color and a lack of visual cohesion with the embedded video. This inconsistency is something I would like to address in my future works. Also, I didn't account for varying screen sizes during the coding process, which may result in alignment issues on different devices.

For future work, I will meticulously plan the framework, considering content and design cohesion. I will also prioritize responsive design to ensure a good user experience across different devices.
